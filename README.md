### [Game Database & History](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Local-Storage)
- [**Local-first persistence**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Local-Storage) — all game data (moves, results, metadata) is written to localStorage immediately and never blocks gameplay; a background sync timer pushes data to the server every 10 seconds
- [**Offline resilience**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Local-Storage) — if the server is down, games are fully preserved locally and sync automatically when connectivity returns
- [**Idempotent sync**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Server-Sync) — duplicate moves are safely deduplicated via server-side UNIQUE constraints; partial syncs resume from where they left off
- [**Server-side storage**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Server-Sync) — synced games are stored via REST API in a SQLite database (see [chess-api](https://github.com/bh679/chess-api))
- [**Game history browser**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Game-Browser) — browse past games with player info, results, and move counts
- [**Replay viewer**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Replay-Viewer) — step through any saved game move by move with:
  - Reconstructed board positions
  - Horizontal move strip with scroll navigation
  - Reconstructed clock display from move timestamps
  - Playback controls (play/pause, step forward/back, jump to start/end)
  - Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, space for play/pause)
- [**URL routing**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-URL-Routing) — shareable hash-based URLs for game views (`/#/replay?gameid=42`, `/#/games`, `/#/history`, `/#/live`); URL updates live as you navigate with no page refresh; path-based URLs redirect to hash equivalents

### [Analysis](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Board-Analysis)
- [**Post-game summary**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Post-Game-Summary) — chess.com-style summary screen with win-probability-based per-player accuracy, per-player average move time, and 10 move classification types (Brilliant, Great, Best, Excellent, Good, Book, Inaccuracy, Mistake, Miss, Blunder); auto-triggers after every game, also available via "Game Summary" button in replay mode; multiplayer game summary uses coordinate-based move replay for reliable reconstruction across all game modes; avg move time shows immediately during analysis and for multiplayer games
- [**Board analysis**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Board-Analysis) — Stockfish-powered position evaluation with move classification arrows and accuracy percentages

### [Automation](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Blogging-Agent)
- [**Weekly blog**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Blogging-Agent) — automated weekly development blog posts generated via GitHub Actions and the Anthropic API; publishes to `blog/` directory every Monday

### [User Accounts](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-User-Accounts)
- **Local auth** — register and sign in with username/password (bcrypt hashing, JWT tokens)
- **User profile** — view Glicko-2 ratings (Bullet/Blitz/Rapid/Classical), game history with full filters (result, player type, game type, time control, elo range)
- **Clickable game rows** — click any game in your profile to replay it
- **Friends system** — add friends, accept/reject requests, view friend list
- **Settings sync** — user settings persist across sessions via the server
- **Game claiming** — games are linked to your account at creation; pre-login games are batch claimed on sign-in

### [Deployment](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Deployment-Status-Page)
- [**Deployment status page**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Deployment-Status-Page) — standalone page showing real-time deployment progress with step-by-step status, elapsed timer, deployment history, and auto-redirect on completion; index.html redirects visitors to the deployment page during active deploys
- [**Reliable deploy script**](https://github.com/bh679/chess-client/wiki/Feature:-Deploy-Script-Git-Reset) — deploy script uses `git fetch + reset --hard` instead of `git pull` to prevent deployment failures when the production server has local modifications (e.g. package.json modified after npm install)

### UI
- [**Captured pieces display**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Captured-Pieces) — shows captured pieces with material advantage indicators
- [**Responsive layout**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Responsive-Design) — works on desktop and mobile
- [**Settings panel**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Settings-Panel) — collapsible panel with all game configuration options
- [**Archive menu**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Archive-Browser) — dynamic archive discovery with navigation between versions; opens in new tab from main app, same tab within archives
- [**Video board squares**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Video-Board-Squares) — during video calls, camera feeds display as a mosaic across the board (white player on light squares, black player on dark squares) using CSS checkerboard masks
- [**Video feed color tint**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Video-Feed-Color-Tint) — board-colored tint overlay on video feeds indicating whose turn it is (10% on active side, 30% on waiting side)
- [**Face tracking video centering**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Face-Tracking-Video-Centering) — real-time face detection (MediaPipe) centers and normalizes faces on the board; white player offset left, black player offset right for a facing-each-other effect
- [**Hidden video popup on board**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-Hide-Video-Popup-on-Board) — when video board mode is active, the floating video popup is hidden to avoid redundancy
- [**WebRTC reliability fix**](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Feature:-WebRTC-ICE-Fix) — ICE candidate queuing prevents race-condition drops; dynamic TURN server config via `/api/chess/ice-servers` for NAT traversal
- [**Cropped video stream**](https://github.com/bh679/chess-client/wiki/Feature:-Cropped-Video-Stream) — face-tracked 480×480 canvas stream transmitted over WebRTC instead of raw camera; face tracking runs only on the local feed; both players see identical output regardless of board size
- [**Video chat reliability**](https://github.com/bh679/chess-client/wiki/Feature:-Video-Chat) — Chrome-compatible face tracking (off-screen video instead of display:none), race condition fix for remote stream on joiners, face tracking fallback to raw camera, explicit play() for iOS Safari
- [**Inline lobby panel**](https://github.com/bh679/chess-client/wiki/Feature:-Lobby-Redesign) — pre-game lobby shown inline below the board (not a modal); room code in header; pieces faded at 30% opacity; camera feed on board squares during lobby preview; ready button with dynamic labels

## Roadmap

See the [project roadmap](https://github.com/bh679/Chess/wiki/Roadmap) for planned features, priorities, and status tracking.

## Dependencies

### Server (required for game history)

The game database runs on a separate Node.js server: **[chess-api](https://github.com/bh679/chess-api)**

The client uses a local-first architecture: all game data is written to localStorage immediately and synced to the server in the background. If the server is unreachable, games are fully preserved locally and sync when connectivity returns. The game history browser and replay viewer require server connectivity to fetch past games.

| Dependency | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| chess-api server | >= 1.10.0000 | Game storage REST API (SQLite) |
| Apache mod_proxy | any | Proxies `/api/*` to the Node.js server |

### Client-side (bundled, no install needed)

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| chess.js | Chess rules engine |
| Stockfish WASM | AI opponent (Web Worker) |

## Getting Started

No build step or install needed. Open `index.html` in a browser or serve the directory with any static file server:

```bash
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server
```

For full functionality (game saving and history), set up the [chess-api](https://github.com/bh679/chess-api) server and configure Apache to proxy `/api` requests.
